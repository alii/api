# api

This is a small microservice running on [Hop](https://hop.io) that provides a simple API for me to interact with my [personal website](https://alistair.sh) as well as other services I run.

Currently it only has an ingest for updating my "personal stats" (which only consists of my location being stored in Lanyard right now). I made this so that I could POST from Apple shortcuts without having to do some hacky stuff around the limitations of shortcuts.

Feel free to add your suggestions and fork it to make your own personal API. There's no license üëç
